# Introduction

B1000 is a backup system created to fulfill needs for an easy and
reliable backup mechanism. Main design goals were:

* no central scheduler
* use standard Unix tools as much as possible (for both backup and restore process)
* possibility to do backup to several storages
* data may be pushed to a central storage from clients as well as pulled from clients to a central storage
* extremely automated and transparent centralized monitoring
* parallel pre-scripts execution and copying data, as well as parallel copies
* consistent directory structure across all backups

# General info

This chapter gives general description of how B1000 works. Think of it as a
gentle introduction to the Devil Himself. If you're robot, you may prefer to
start from Technical info chapter. Or, if you think you're bright enough and
prefer to learn by example, jump to Examples section.

B1000 is in fact a sophisticated wrapper for rsync written in python, which
uses [ini-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) configuration files.
Each time B1000 is run, it takes the configuration file
(**/etc/b1000/b1000.cfg** by default) and processes all jobs defined there.
Optionally, you may specify which jobs to run (as a program arguments).

There is no dedicated backup scheduler. We use system's cron for that.

## The idea of push and pull

There are two ways of doing backup with B1000:

1. **Push** - this is the way we do backup on trusted clients. Data is pushed from a client to central storage.
2. **Pull** - this is how we do backup on untrusted clients. Data is pulled from clients by the storage server. Idea is that untrusted clients don't connect to a storage server from "the outside".

To setup proper push or pull backup, one needs to create a job with adequate
destinations and reports. This is covered by detailed description of B1000
configuration section later on.

For now, let's see most common scenarios for pull- and push- type backups.

### Push

Push is the simple way of doing backups with B1000. It goes like this:

  * Job is run on a client by cron
  * Data is sent over rsync to a destination (storage server)
  * Report (information about state of backup for the monitoring) is written to a MySQL database

### Pull

This is The Complicated Way Of Doing Backups. It requires setting up **two
jobs**: **passive** and **pull**, one on client and one on storage,
respectively. This is how it works:

  * **Passive** job starts on a client and prepares data, if necessary (with pre- script).
  * Monitoring data is written on a client to a local report file.
  * Job enters "copying" state and waits until the data is pulled by another job, running on storage server.
  * That another job, **pull** job, starts in the meantime on the storage and waits until data is ready for copying (by periodically checking the remote report file). Report contents are also written to central MySQL database, for monitoring to see what's going on.
  * When data is ready, storage pulls it from a client and notifies it when it's done pulling.
  * When client sees that storage finished pulling data, it continues with the job, by finishing the whole process with optional post- script and some internal cleanup tasks.

All the communication between client and storage is done using rsync. For that
to work, client needs to share the following with storage server (using
rsync):

  * (read-only) directory where backup files are stored (this is either "live" part of the filesystem or some directory "aside", where backup files are written by a pre- script)
  * (read-write) directory with report files, used also for synchronization between passive and pull jobs.

## The idea behind monitoring

The idea behind monitoring of B1000 work is that information about all jobs
run ends up in one central database. This is easy for all push-type jobs,
which run on trusted hosts that may have direct access to such database. But
when data is pulled from an untrusted host, we need to pull monitoring data
the same way and then store it in the database. Job running on storage server
acts as a "monitoring proxy" in such configuration.

## The idea behind slave servers

Common practice is to offload production servers by doing backups on slave
servers. B1000 knows that and allows user to configure backup job with few
additional parameters which allow to:

  * establish logical relation between slave and master - this is required by monitoring to know that by doing backup of eg. MySQL instance running on 3307 on host slave3 we in fact did backup "payments" production database
  * check how much slave was lagging behind master when backup started - this allows us to monitor if data in backup is "fresh enough"

## The idea behind instances

There is one more freaky concept in B1000: **instances**. We often have a
configuration, where one physical server holds more than one instance of a
service, for example multiple instances of MySQL. As we are usually
lazy bastards, we don't want to configure backup every time we configure new
instance. We want it to happen automagically. Enter **instances**! (NOTE:
Truth is that we're not lazy, we just want to be sure, that we do have a
backup. And the best option is to make it happen automatically, without
relaying on forgetful humans)

With B1000 you can configure backup for all MySQL instances in one job. You
just need to use `instances` option to execute a script that returns list of
all available instances on a host. B1000 then spawns one separate job per each
instance.

Instances play well with slave servers too, cause this is how we roll.

# Technical info

## Installation

B1000 requires MySQLdb python module which can be installed via packaging system:

 * Debian: `apt-get install python-mysqldb`
 * FreeBSD: `pkg_add -r py27-MySQLdb51`

## Command line options

Command line for B1000 looks as follows:

`b1000 [options] [job[/instance]] ...`

Available options are (none of them is required):

| Short option | Long option | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| -h | --help | Display help on command line syntax
| -v | --version | Display program version
| -f | --cfg | Use alternative config file (default is to use /etc/b1000/b1000.cfg)
| -c | --copy | Retry jobs that failed during copying data

If no job/instance is given in program arguments, B1000 runs all configured
jobs. In other case, it runs only jobs specified by the user.

Rules for specifying jobs to run:

  * Each argument contains a job name or job/instance name pair (see instances to know more about ).
  * If only job name is given, and there are instances configured for this job, job is run for each instance.
  * If job/instance pair is given, job is run for specified instance only.

## Configuration

B1000 configuration is [ini-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
Configuration file consists of arbitrary sections with also arbitrary set of
required and allowed options. There are few features additional to "classic"
ini-style configuration, described in detail in option_types

Section naming for B1000 configuration is arbitrary. Following sections are
allowed:

  * **[global]** - global configuration options configure various aspects of B1000 and also provide common configuration for jobs.
  * **[job:JOB_NAME]** - job is the core resource in B1000 configuration. It defines a backup process for a certain set of data.
  * **[dest:DESTINATION_NAME]** - destination is a definition of a place where backup is stored.
  * **[report:REPORT_NAME]** - reports are places where B1000 stores information on backup progress. Reports are used for monitoring purposes only.

For each section (and sometimes even for a certain section type) there is a
set of required and allowed keys. B1000 checks each section keys for
correctness and reports to a logfile if something is not right.

### Global section

Global section configures various aspects of B1000 and also provide common
configuration for jobs. Options marked red are required.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **log_format** | `%(asctime)-15s %(levelname)-7s [%(threadName)-10s] %(message)s` | Format of log file line (see [here](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) for details)
| **log_level** | INFO | level of logs printed. One of: **INFO**, **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARNING**, **ERROR**, **FATAL**
| **log_file** | /dev/stdout | where to print logs
| **backup_dir** | – | path to store intermediate backup files
| **scripts_dir** | – | path where pre-, post- and other scripts used by b1000 are located. This is a shortcut, just for your convenience
| **status_dir** | – | path where status filed for failed jobs are stored
| **copy_retries** | 3 | retries for failed copy operations (if destination type supports it)
| **copy_retry_min_sleep** | 60 | sleep between copy retries (in seconds) (if destination type supports it)

### Job section

Job is the core resource in B1000 configuration. It defines a backup process
for a certain set of data. There are three so called **directions** for jobs
in B1000:

  * **Push** - pushes data from client to storage server, also does the pre- and post- scripts
  * **Passive** - waits for **Pull** job to pull data, also does pre- and post- scripts
  * **Pull** - pulls data from a client, doesn't do any pre- nor post- scripts

#### Option types

Options in configuration file are set with "key = value" syntax. But for job
definitions there are three additional features regarding setting options.

##### Run-time options

Besides options set explicitly by user in a configuration file, B1000 sets two
additional run-time options in context of each job/instance. Those may be used
(see: referencing_options) anywhere in the same block, and are primarily used
as arguments while calling shell scripts that set **master_host**,
**master_instance** and **data_age** variables.

Options set by B1000 for each job in run-time:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| instance | currently processed instance, as specified in **instances**
| host | hostname where the job is run
| start_time | timestamp of a job start in form: %Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S (useful for temporary directories, for example)

##### Dynamic Options

Dynamic options may be set to output of an external script. Every time such
option is referenced, script is run and output is taken as value for a key.
Only few options may be dynamically set (see table with job options below).
Dynamic options exist only for **push** jobs. Syntax for using dynamic options
is:

    
    key = !/path/to/executable/script
    

##### Referencing options

When setting value of a key, user may use the following syntax to reference
value of another option in the same block, or, if not found, in global
section:

    
    key = $other_key
    

This sets value of a **key** to value of **other_key**. This is useful when
setting a dynamic variable using external script, for example:

    
    master_host = !/usr/lib/b1000/scripts/master.sh $instance
    

Or for using the same prefix path in multiple places, for example:

    
    [global]
    scripts_dir = /usr/local/lib/b1000/scripts
    ...
    [job:system]
    pre = $scripts_dir/system_pre.sh
    

#### Push jobs

Push is the most feature-rich type of job.

| Option | dynamic | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **direction** | – | **push**
| **type** | – | **full**, **sync**
| **instances** | + | List of instances to back up.
| **report** | – | List of reports to write
| **dest** | – | List of destinations to copy backup to
| **data_age** | + | age of the data being backed up (e.g. slave server delay)
| **master_host** | + | master (real production) host which holds the data we back up
| **master_instance** | + | master (real production) instance which holds the data we back up
| **pre** | – | script to run before copying data
| **post** | – | script to run after copying data
| **include** | – | files and directories to include in backup
| **exclude** | – | files and directories to exclude from backup

#### Passive jobs

**Passive** job requires twin **Pull** job set up on storage server to work correctly.

For passive jobs there is no **include** nor **exclude** options, as this is
something that **pull** job decides on.

Also, there is no **instances** option (together with other instance-related
ones). Reason for this is that currently
passive/pull configuration is only intended for simple cases. This may change
in the future.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **direction** | **passive**
| **report** | List of reports to write
| **dest** | List of destinations to copy backup to
| **pre** | script to run before copying data
| **post** | script to run after copying data

#### Pull jobs

**Pull** job requires twin **Passive** job set up on a client to work correctly.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **direction** | **pull**
| **type** | **full**, **sync**
| **report** | List of reports to write
| **dest** | List of destinations to copy backup to
| **include** | files and directories to include in backup
| **exclude** | files and directories to exclude from backup
| **report_source** | rsync location on client side where to look for reports
| **report_poll_wait** | how long to wait between remote report checks (in seconds)
| **report_poll_retries** | how many times to check remote report

#### More on options

##### Notes on destination paths and job types

We wanted to achieve one specific goal with B1000: that all backups would end
in a simple, consistent directory structure. No more asking questions: "where
is backup of _____ stored?". That means we left only little space for user to
play with destination directories.

There are two types of backup in B1000: **full** and **sync**. There is no
incremental backup, as you might have expected. Although **Sync** does that.
Kinda.

  * **full** type jobs do just what you expect them to. Every time job is run, it makes a full backup of all files configured with `include` option. Backup is stored on destination in a directory constructed the following way:  
`$path/job_name/Y-M-D-DoW/host-instance-master_host-master_instance-Y-M-D-DOW-
HH:MM:SS`

  * **sync** type jobs synchronize set of files and directories configured with `include` option with files on destination. It's just a regular rsync.  
Backup is stored on destination in a same directory every time, constructed
the following way:

`$path/job_name/host-instance-master_host-master_instance`

If any of: `instance, master_host, master_instance` is absent for a job, it is
omitted in the destination path together with the leading dash.

`$path` is an option specified in destination definition. This is either a
local directory (eg. `/srv/backup/`) or remote rsync module (eg.
`rsync://backup-3/b1000`), depending on where you want to store resulting
backup. But in real world local directories make sense only for pull-type
jobs. All push jobs should normally write backups to a remote rsync server.

##### Report

Each job needs at least one report. Report lists consists of **ELEMENTS**
separated by **SEPARATORS**, where:

  * **ELEMENT** is: `[a-zA-Z][-_a-zA-Z0-9]+`
  * **SEPARATOR** is: `[ ,]+`

Example:

    
    report = main hd backup
    

##### Destination

Each job needs at least one destination. Syntax for destination lists is as
for reports, but with two additional special modifiers:

  * / (slash) - joins two or more destinations and tells B1000 to randomize order in which they are considered when copying data. Following example configures a job to copy data sequentially to three destinations, but in random order 
    
    dest = atm/tele/hd
    

  * & (and) - tells B100 to start copying to destination in background and continue with other destinations. Following example configures a job to copying data to **hd** in background, then immediately proceed with **tele**, and when **tele** is done, data will be copied to **atm**
    
    dest = hd& tele atm
    

  * Combinations of those two modifiers are permitted. For example, to start copying to **hd** in background, then proceed with **tele** and **atm**, sequentialy, in random order, use: 
    
    dest = hd& tele/atm
    

##### Instances

Syntax for specifying instance lists in configuration file is similar to
report lists: **ELEMENTS** separated by **SEPARATORS**. One addition is that
when filled by an external script, newline can be a separator too:

  * **ELEMENT** is: `[a-zA-Z][-_a-zA-Z0-9]+`
  * **SEPARATOR** is: `[ \n,]+`

How to name an instance? You choose. It may be a port number, instance name,
or whatever that allows you to identify an instance.

When B1000 finds a job in configuration file that has `instances` parameter
set, instead of preparing a single job, it spawns one job per instance. Each
of this jobs get additional configuration parameter set in run-time:
`instance`.

##### master_host, master_instance, data_age

If you make a backup of a production service, but instead of doing it on
production server, you use a slave host, you may want to inform B1000 what is
the real master host/instance. This is needed by monitoring to know, that
backup of certain production service took place, but was done in some other
place than the real host.

Also, in case of doing backup on a slave host, it may be crucial to know if it
was lagging behind its master at the time.

Those options may be set statically, but the real world scenario is: You are
doing backups on a slave host holding multiple instances of production
services, eg. MySQL slaves. In such scenario user may configure `master_host`,
`master_instance` and `data_age` to execute scripts which take run-time option
`$instance` as an argument, check what is the master host, master instance and
data age for that given instance, and return the actual value.

With a job configured in such way, you don't need to worry about backups of
newly created instances or removed ones.

##### pre, post

Each job consists of three stages:

  * pre- script
  * copying data
  * post- script

Pre- and post- scripts are any executables that are run locally on client that
runs a job (you may have only one pre- and one post-job). This is another
place where `$instance` run-time option comes in handy. You may, for example,
have one pre- script for doing MySQL dumps, which takes instance name as
an argument.

Exit code of a pre- or post- script is what matters for B1000. If a script
exits with anything other than '0', B1000 treats it as an error. Output of
pre- and post- scripts is written to B1000 log file.

##### include, exclude

Those two options tell B1000 what to backup and what to skip. `include` is in
fac the first argument of rsync call, `exclude` holds values for a series of
`--exclude` rsync options. For example:

    
    include = /etc /var/spool/cron /usr/local/bin
    exclude = *.tmp *~ *.log
    

will translate to something like: `rsync ... --exclude=**.tmp --exclude=**~
--exclude=*.log /etc /var/spool/cron /usr/local/bin rsync://destination/...`

### Destination section

Destination is a definition of a place where backup is stored. There are two
types of destinations.

#### Active

This type of destination is **invalid for passive jobs**. It is meant to be
used in jobs that actually store data (**push** and **pull**)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **type** | **active** - regular or in-place push backups 
| **path** | where to store files (both local directories and rsync:// are allowed)
| **exclude** | files excluded from copy
| **verbosity** | how verbose should the copying process be (1-3, default 1)

#### Passive

This type of destination is **valid only for passive jobs**. It doesn't copy
data, it waits for **pull** job to download it.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **type** | **passive** - job waits until another job pulls the data (valid only for "passive" jobs) 
| **host** | hostname of a client which pulls data
| **timeout** | timeout (in second) for data being pulled

### Report section

Reports are places where B1000 stores information on backup progress. Reports
are used for monitoring purposes only. There are two types of report B1000 can
write: mysql (MySQL database) and file (locally written file). Each one has
different options. Options marked red are required.

#### Database

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **type** | **mysql** - for reports stored in MySQL database 
| **server** | database server
| **db** | database name
| **user** | database user
| **password** | database user password

#### File

This kind of report is required for passive jobs.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **type** | **file** - for reports stored in files 
| **path** | directory where reports are written

# Examples

## Push jobs

**Common sections**

Let's first define some common sections used by example push jobs:

    
    [global]
    log_level = INFO
    log_file = /var/log/b1000.log
    backup_dir = /srv/backup
    scripts_dir = /usr/local/lib/b1000/scripts
    status_dir = /srv/b1000/statuses
    copy_retries = 3
    copy_retry_min_sleep = 60
    

This is our central database for b1000 monitoring:

    
    [report:main]
    type = mysql
    server = db-b1000
    user = b1000
    password = AndrzejJestCudownyIPrzystojny
    db = b1000
    

Those are storage servers that we use to store all backups:

    
    [dest:tele]
    type = active
    path = rsync://backup-1/b1000
    verbosity = 1
    
    
    [dest:atm]
    type = active
    path = rsync://backup-2/b1000
    verbosity = 1
    
    
    [dest:hd]
    type = active
    path = rsync://backup-3/b1000
    verbosity = 1
    

### Simple backup of `/etc`

Backup whole `/etc` by pushing it to `tele` and `atm` sequentially, in random
order. Store monitoring in central database.

    
    [job:etc]
    direction = push
    type = full
    dest = tele/atm
    report = main
    include = /etc
    

### Less simple backup of `/etc`

Same as above, but with tar/gzip.

    
    [job:etc]
    direction = push
    type = full
    dest = tele/atm
    report = main
    pre = tar czf $backup_dir/system_backup.tar.gz /etc
    include = $backup_dir/system_backup.tar.gz
    post = rm -f $backup_dir/system_backup.tar.gz
    

### Backup of MySQL binlogs.

  1. Just before starting backup of MySQL binlogs, we want to switch to a new binlog, so the binlog set is as fresh as possible. We do it with a script run as `pre` script.
  2. We want to make backup of MySQL binlogs to one directory per server. All files in one directory. Thus, we do `sync` backup.
  3. Also, we wand to copy all binlogs to `hd` as soon as possible, and in the meantime to `tele` and `atm`.

Configuration for the above looks like this:
    
    [job:binlogs]
    direction = push
    type = sync
    dest = hd& tele/atm
    report = main
    pre = $scripts_dir/mysql_rotate_logs.sh
    include = /var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.*
    

### Backup all instances of MySQL on a slave host

This is a full-flavor push job with `instances` and all the bells and
whistles. Seriously, intense stuff.

    
    [job:mysqldb]
    direction = push
    type = full
    dest = hd& tele/atm
    report = main
    instances = $scripts_dir/mysql_get_instances.sh
    data_age = $scripts_dir/mysql_get_slave_delay.sh $instance
    master_host = $scripts_dir/mysql_get_master_host.sh $instance
    master_instance = $scripts_dir/mysql_get_master_instance.sh $instance
    pre = $scripts_dir/mysql_dump_instance.sh $instance $backup_dir/$instance-$start_time
    post = rm -rf $backup_dir/$instance-$start_time
    include = $backup_dir/$instance-$start_time/*
    

## Passive/Pull jobs

To pull backup from a client we need setup one (passive) job there, and one
(pull) job on the storage server.

**Client**
    
    [report:localfile]
    type = file
    path = /srv/b1000/reports
    
    [dest:atm]
    type = passive
    host = backup-2
    timeout = 10
    
    [job:ext]
    direction = passive
    dest = atm
    report = localfile
    pre = $scripts_dir/ext_dump.sh
    

**Notes:**

  * Passive job needs to write report to a local file
  * Directory with reports needs to be readable over rsync by storage server
  * Backup job runs pre-script which prepares data for backup (to some arbitrary directory in this case, hardcoded in the pre-script)
  * This directory needs to be readable over rsync by storage server
  * Job doesn't specify any `include`-s, it's job is only to prepare data available for storage using rsync.

**Storage**
    
    [report:main]
    type = mysql
    server = db-b1000
    user = b1000
    password = erjcgnhy3p4i8cg2ny34ilugfcnh
    db = b1000
    
    [dest:local]
    type = active
    path = /srv/stor1/b1000
    verbosity = 1
    
    [job:system]
    direction = pull
    type = full
    dest = local
    report_source = rsync://ext/reports
    report_poll_wait = 3
    report_poll_retries = 3
    report = main
    include = rsync://ext/backup
    exclude = *.tmp *.log
    

**Notes:**

  * Pull job has the destination configured as a local directory. This probably should be a directory where other backups are stored too.
  * `report_source` and `include` are two rsync resources made available on the untrusted host
